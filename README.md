ðŸš€ Amazon Sales Data Analysis | Power BI Dashboard Project ðŸ“Š

In this project, I worked on analysing Amazon sales data using Power BI, where I performed data pre-processing, added custom columns, and created dynamic measures for enhanced insights. I designed a comprehensive dashboard with Amazon's theme colours, giving it a sleek and professional look.

Key Highlights: ðŸ”¹ Pre-processed and cleaned the sales data, added essential columns for better understanding and accuracy. ðŸ”¹ Created custom measures and calculated columns to generate insightful metrics such as sales totals, filtered sales. ðŸ”¹ Designed interactive and visually engaging dashboard elements, including product tooltips and a calendar for sorting and filtering sales data by date. ðŸ”¹ Incorporated product category filters to enable dynamic data exploration and facilitate better decision-making. ðŸ”¹ Ensured smooth and accurate visualizations, aligning with the Amazon theme to maintain a cohesive user experience.

This project demonstrates my skills in data transformation, visualization, and designing user-friendly dashboards that drive business insights.
